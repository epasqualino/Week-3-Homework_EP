PASSWORD GENERATOR 

When the "Generate Password" button is clicked, a window prompt appears asking the user the length of their password. If the user enters less than 8 or more than 128, another prompt will appear asking them to select a length between the specified range. Once a proper length is entered, the user is prompted with four different parameters to include: uppercase characters, lowercase characters, numbers, special characters. If no parameters are selected, a prompt will appaer telling the user to select at least one. The prompts are then cycled through again. A password is then generated and shown in the text box.
